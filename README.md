Okay. Here are some explanation for MrBen. <br>

<h2>Structure </h2>
-scenarios: scenarios describing the test <br>
-setup: scripts to prepare machine before the test <br>
-network: scripts to benchmark the network <br>
-networkconf: config files for network benchmark <br>
-disk: scripts to benchmark the storage <br>
-diskconf: config files for storage benchmark <br>
-customscript: scripts to run before the test start <br>

<h2>Goals </h2>
The tool is use to benchmark a distributed system. We use Flexible IO (FIO) to measure the disk performance and Iperf to measure network performance. <br>
